There are almost equal hours of darkness and light. The perfect time to work with our shadow, release, put down heavy and return to YOU. Fall is a time to reflect on what has shifted, what new seeds we have planted. A time to let go and move from a place of gratitude for what has come to fruition. Join us for this powerful practice. Please have a journal, a comfortable place to be seated and feel free to create yourself a sacred space for practice.'

From low energy levels to unimpressive results in the gym, I knew that I had to do something. So, using my SuperLearning skills, I went through MOUNTAINS of information to develop a safe, healthy, legal, and sustainable regimen to increase my testosterone. And the results were amazing. I now have more vigor and energy, a stronger physique and even more success with the opposite sex and in my career. And, lucky for you, I’ve packaged everything I know about safely and naturally boosting your testosterone into one action packed course — Become a SuperHuman. Become a SuperHuman has 33 lectures of high-quality video content, all designed to help you develop a clear "action plan" for improving your health from the ground up.'

The water bottles are replacing the weights. At the extra tracks, I am introducing how to work out with a big ball, a small stability ball, a power circle and stretching and mobility flow.'

You will start by learning the fundamentals (neutral position, correct breathing, where the core muscles are and how to engage them) and move through short classes to prepare you for the sequence.  In a short time you will feel the incredible benefits Pilates offers. A few well-designed movements, properly performed in a balanced sequence, are worth hours of doing sloppy calisthenics or forced contortion. Joseph Pilates This course is summed up so well in this quote.  I have seen clients transform their bodies in a few short months by following the complete Pilates Classical Mat sequence.  Although the physical changes are astonishing in such a short time.'

        description: 'Most Yoga programs do not properly understand back function as it relates to the rest of the body.They just recommend upper extremity exercises in the same rep and set sequence with no diversification.No back flexibility, core, or leg exercises are recommended. A balance of strength and flexibility of all the muscles around the back is essential for injury prevention. In addition, proper back function is linked to the movements of the lower extremity, the pelvis, and the trunk. This Yoga program includes dozens of different strength and flexibility exercises for the back, core, and legs that are performed in small groups with changing set and repetition sequences. It is no secret that the medical community is slowly but surely accepting the idea that Yoga can bring relief for persistent back pain, and it is taking notice of how healing Yoga can be for back pain.'
